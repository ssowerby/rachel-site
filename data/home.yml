      Are you struggling with -
        | Mind | Body |
        |---|---|
        | Excessive worry           | High blood pressure |
        | Panic attacks             | IBS | 
        | Inability to switch off   | Can’t lose weight |
        | And more..                | And more.. |

      A stressed and anxious nervous system can result in all of the above symptoms and more.
        
      I work with people to reduce their stress and anxiety for a calmer nervous system, quieter mind and healthier body.
      
      Even if you know your issue has another cause, being highly stressed or anxious can exacerbate it. Because long term high levels of stress and anxiety impair your thinking, immune system and bodily functions. (link to a page explaining fight or flight)
      
      By combining hypnotherapy, coaching and EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) I work with you to reduce your stress and anxiety inorder to relieve your symptoms.
      
      You can work with me 1-2-1 online via Zoom and also in private group training.

      # A bit about me

      It’s not by accident I’ve found myself as a calming coach. 

      Before I had any professional experience in this area I had plenty personally. 

      And it was that personal knowledge of the effects of stress and anxiety which lead me to train as a clinical hypnotherapist and start my journey to becoming a coach.
